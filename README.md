# consus
Universal object/file store
Consus provides a single API to interface with a number of storage media. It can run as a service and provides a simple RESTful endpoint to local files, NFS volumes, Google Drive, Box.com, and hopefully more. It also provides a FUSE interface to its storage. It supports Hierarchical Storage Management so that you can migrate files from local storage to remote without your application being aware of the difference.

Consus is under heavy development, and is not ready for general use.
